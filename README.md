# Fraud-Detection-of-Bank-Transaction-Data-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
Worked on 5 machine learning algorithms to check on fraudulent bank transactions and check the working accuracy of all the algorithms.

ALGORITHMS USED TO IMPLEMENT:
-  LOGISTIC REGRESSION
-  DECISION TREE 
-  RANDOM FOREST
-  GRADIENT BOOSTING
-  kNN(K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR)
