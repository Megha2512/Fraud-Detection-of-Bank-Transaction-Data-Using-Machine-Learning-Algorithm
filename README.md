# Fraud-Detection-of-Bank-Transaction-Data-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
Worked on 5 machine learning algorithms to check on fraudulent bank transactions and check the working accuracy of all the algorithms.

ALGORITHMS USED TO IMPLEMENT:
-  LOGISTIC REGRESSION
-  DECISION TREE 
-  RANDOM FOREST
-  GRADIENT BOOSTING
-  kNN(K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR)

Implemented all the algorithms individually.
To use the code download the files and run it on Jupiter Notebook.
And for vs code install the required libraries on your local pc with command - "**pip install library_name**".
